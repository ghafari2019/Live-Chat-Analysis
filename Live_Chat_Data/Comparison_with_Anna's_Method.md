### **Comparison of Anna's Approach and Our Approach in Identifying the Reason for Contact**

When identifying the **reason for contact** from each transcript, Anna's approach and our approach differ significantly in their ability to analyze and extract this information.

## **1. Granularity of Data in Relation to Reason for Contact**

### **Anna's Approach:**
- **Granularity:** Works at the **conversation level**, focusing on handover moments between the chatbot and the agent.
- **Reason for Contact Extraction:** Limited to **handover transitions**, potentially missing broader conversation context.

### **Our Approach:**
- **Granularity:** Operates at the **session level**, filtering based on interaction counts and capturing full-session context.
- **Reason for Contact Extraction:** Provides a **broader view** of the conversation, making it easier to analyze the full intent.

## **2. Handling Complex Conversations**

### **Anna's Approach:**
- **Limitation with Complex Conversations:** May miss critical context if the reason for contact is **discussed before the handover**.
- **Use Case:** Works best when the reason for contact is **explicitly stated before handover** or **implied in the chatbot's transition**.

### **Our Approach:**
- **Better for Complex Conversations:** Captures **all conversation exchanges**, including those before and after handover.
- **Use Case:** Suitable for **evolving reasons for contact** that unfold throughout the conversation.

## **3. Interaction Count and Reason for Contact**

### **Anna's Approach:**
- **Limited Interaction Context:** Focuses on **handover markers**, potentially missing early parts of the conversation.
- **Implication:** If the reason is introduced early and **not revisited**, it may **fail to capture it fully**.

### **Our Approach:**
- **Interaction Count as a Clue:** Filters sessions with **high interaction counts**, allowing for **more in-depth analysis**.
- **Implication:** Provides **richer context**, making it easier to extract **multiple potential reasons for contact**.

## **4. Handling Specific Channels (e.g., WhatsApp) and Contact Reason**

### **Anna's Approach:**
- **Channel Limitations:** Does not explicitly **exclude WhatsApp**, which could introduce **noise and inconsistencies**.
- **Implication:** WhatsApp interactions might lead to **misinterpretation of contact reasons**.

### **Our Approach:**
- **WhatsApp Exclusion:** Explicitly **filters out WhatsApp**, ensuring cleaner data.
- **Implication:** **More reliable** insights, avoiding **channel-based inconsistencies**.

## **5. Efficiency in Analyzing Reasons for Contact Across Large Datasets**

### **Anna's Approach:**
- **Computational Efficiency:** **Expensive**, as it processes **individual handover moments**.
- **Impact:** Harder to scale for **large datasets**.

### **Our Approach:**
- **Efficient Session-Level Analysis:** Works with **session-level aggregates**, making it scalable.
- **Impact:** **Faster processing** and **more effective pattern detection** in large datasets.

## **Conclusion**

### **Anna's Approach:**
- Best for **analyzing chatbot-to-agent transitions**.
- **May miss context** from before/after handover.
- **Lacks explicit handling for WhatsApp**, potentially introducing inconsistencies.

### **Our Approach:**
- Captures the **entire session**, ensuring **full conversation context**.
- **Scalable and efficient**, making it ideal for large datasets.
- **Excludes WhatsApp**, leading to **cleaner and more accurate insights**.

This approach is **better suited for complex interactions** and **ensures a more comprehensive analysis of customer intent**.
